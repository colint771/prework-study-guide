# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This Study Guide was created for bootcamp students who were going through the prework. It helps keep students organized by containing notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript all in one place. In developing this Study Guide, I created a basic foundation of knowledge in HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript
